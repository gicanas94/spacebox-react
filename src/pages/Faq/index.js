    <h1>What is this all about?</h1>

    <p>
      Spacebox is a platform designed for two types of people: those who like
      to write and those who like to read what other people write.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the home page you can filter the spaces depending on what you want to
      read, the idea is that you always find content that you find interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to create your own space and start writing or maybe just make
      a comment in the space of another person, you
      can <span><Link to={ROUTES.SIGN_UP}>create an account</Link></span> (don't worry, is
      free) or <Link to={ROUTES.SIGN_IN}>sign in</Link> using your favorite
      social media account.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment of thinking about the idea of creating this page I thought
      it would be longer, but I'm running out of imagination so... I think this
      is it <Emoji label="Face Neutral Skeptical" symbol="ðŸ™„" />
    </p>

    <Link to={ROUTES.HOME}>Enjoy!</Link>
  </Box>
